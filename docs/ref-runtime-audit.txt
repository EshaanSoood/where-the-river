Runtime Audit â€” Share Button (dev)

Mount state:
- share-mounted logged with flags: meHasUrl, profileHasUrl

Click path instrumentation:
- on click: logs { t, kind: 'share-click', hasHandler: true, enabled, referralInState }
- last-mile read: GET /api/my-referral-link if state empty
- success path: navigator.share OR clipboard OR textarea-fallback

CSS/DOM checks:
- pointer-events on button and ancestors logged if blocking
- dev-only pointerEvents auto-enable applied when necessary

Latest observation (to be updated after manual test):
- handleShareClick fired: TBD
- had state referral_url at click: TBD
- session fetch returned url: TBD
- path used (share/clipboard/fallback): TBD
- overlay/pointer-events issue: TBD
- PASS/FAIL: TBD (must share/copy on first click without reload)

Share UX update (2025-10-24):
- Main button opens overlay only; all shares via tiles.
- Verified: no navigator.share on main button; overlay opens on first click.
- Outcome: PASS once overlay appears and tiles function.
