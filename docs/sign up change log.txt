- Removed the legacy Participate client and layout files and kept app/(auth)/participate/page.tsx as a minimal redirect with a LEGACY comment.
- Added components/participate/openParticipate.ts exporting openParticipateOverlay() with debounce and a lightweight telemetry call.
- Wired components/BelowMap.tsx to listen for the global participate:open event and open the overlay in guest mode; no auto-open retained.
- Updated app/(app)/r/[referral]/page.tsx to a client component with a button calling openParticipateOverlay() instead of navigating to /participate.
- Removed any client referred_by: null posting by updating components/DashboardSheet.tsx to omit that field.
- Verified no remaining href="/participate" and no hash-based auto-open logic.

Acceptance checks
- No references to ParticipateClient.tsx or participate/layout.tsx remain.
- /participate still redirects to / and does not auto-open.
- All “Participate” CTAs call openParticipateOverlay() and do not navigate.
- No hash/route auto-open remains.
- No client code sends referred_by: null.
