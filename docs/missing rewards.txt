Rewards missing dedicated modals / wiring
=========================================

Source: `components/RewardsView.tsx` (referencing the static `REWARDS` array).
Below are the five tiers that currently render cards but have no bespoke modal
content or Supabase integration. All styling/details are pulled directly from
the component.


1. 20 boats — `r20`
-------------------
- Title shown: “20 Boats – Watch The Documentary”.
- Body copy rendered:
  “You’ve reached the first island. Here’s an early look at the story behind
   Dream River.”
- Claim state:
  * If the user has ≥20 boats and has not claimed it yet, the card displays a
    “Claim Reward” button. Clicking it only updates client state
    (`claimedIds`/`claimedAt`) and fires local confetti; no backend call or
    modal is attached.
  * Once clicked, the button flips to a disabled “Claimed” button.
- No extra code, files, or dialog appears afterwards.

2. 50 boats — `r50`
-------------------
- Title: “50 Boats – A Live Concert From the Comfort of Your Home”.
- Subtitle: “Exclusive Access To A Recorded Live Show”.
- Body text: “Want to know what the songs sound like when we play them live?”
- Claim mechanics identical to `r20`: optimistic local toggle with confetti,
  no additional modal or Supabase record.

3. 100 boats — `r100`
--------------------
- Title: “100 Boats – Curiosity Killed The Cat”.
- Description: “You can now send your message directly to the creators. Ask
  about the music, the process, or anything that moved you.”
- Claim button behaves the same way—local state only, no modal.

4. 250 boats — `r250`
--------------------
- Title: “250 Boats – Want to Know The Future?”
- Description: “You’ve reached the Silver island — glimpses of what’s to come,
  and an invitation to learn directly from Eshaan.”
- Claim button → purely local state and confetti, no backend/modal.

5. 400 boats — `r400`
--------------------
- Title: “400 Boats – The Golden Island”.
- Description: “You’ve reached the Golden island — thank you for guiding so
  many boats home. We’re going to send you an actual paper boat made by Eshaan
  and a special gift with it.”
- Claim button again just flips to “Claimed” in UI—no modal, no Supabase
  writes.


Next steps if wiring is desired
-------------------------------
- Each tier will need its own modal component (similar to the existing Bronze
  modal) plus a Supabase `user_rewards` upsert to persist fulfillment details.
- For downloadable assets, provide secure links; for service-based rewards
  (lessons, shipping), a payload object (e.g., scheduling info) should be saved
  alongside the reward ID so the backend team can fulfill the promise.
